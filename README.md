Tzu Chi Hospital history museum tv broadcasting system

This is my first attempt at using PHP to write a TV wall playback system, which provides image and video file rotation for three TVs.  

The system is very basic, without a management backend, and media files must be manually uploaded to the server via FTP. Based on the number of media files uploaded, it calculates the pages to display for each screenâ€”nothing more.  

This is simply a PHP programming exercise.
